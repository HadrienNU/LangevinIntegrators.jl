# Statistical tests

This folder contains some test on the validity of the integrator that are only valid within statistical precision.

This includes:

- Stationary distribution with harmonic potential
- Stationary distribution with non-harmonic potential (double-well)
- Velocity autocorrelation for Langevin Integrator
- Velocity autocorrelation for Kernel Integrator
